# PagerfantaBundle

The PagerfantaBundle is a [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) bundle integrating [Pagerfanta](/open-source/packages/pagerfanta/docs) into an application.
    
This bundle is a continuation of the [`WhiteOctoberPagerfantaBundle`](https://github.com/whiteoctober/WhiteOctoberPagerfantaBundle).

The bundle includes:

- A [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) function to render Pagerfanta objects with views and options
- Pagerfanta view which supports Twig templates
- Services to easily use Pagerfanta views anywhere in your application
- Serialization of `Pagerfanta\PagerfantaInterface` objects using the [Symfony Serializer component](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/serializer.html) or the [JMS Serializer](https://jmsyst.com/libs/serializer)
- A flexible API to customize paginated routing
- Default CSS for the `Pagerfanta\View\DefaultView` class
